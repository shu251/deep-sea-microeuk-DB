# Microeukaryote deep-sea database curation project

Pending documentation of key steps we will take to curate deep-sea eukaryotes.

### Origin of data

_Summary of microeuk diversity paper_

### 18S rRNA gene (V4 region)

_Explanation of amplicon sequencing_

1.  Molecular ecology paper ASV tables
2.  Get reference sequences from ASV determination, collect this information. Once this table is completed, upload to Zenodo. Decide on what a "complete" package for this is. (a) fasta sequences, (b) taxonomic IDs, (c) ASV document that can be joined with future iterations of 18S, (d) QIIME2 file
3.  Organize by families or classes. 4 *Pick how to triage these families or classes*
4.  For the taxonomic assignment from PR2, what other information does PR2 give?
5.  Literature search, what else do we know about the ASV?
